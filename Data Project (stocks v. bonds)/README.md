# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Data project** and deals with the American financial market, where treasury bonds and stocks are analysed.
When merging the data we can desribe data and are able to deduct a regression and therby extrapolate data for further analysis.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

´pip install matplotlib-venn´, ´pip install pandas-datareader´ and ´pip install git+https://github.com/elben10/pydst´

This **loades two datasets**:

1. INDKP101.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/INDKP101
1. RAS200.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/RAS200
