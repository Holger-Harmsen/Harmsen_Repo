# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Model Involvement** and a description is found within the ipynb-file.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb). The Project concerns an AS-AD model, which we have tried to expand with a growth in structural GDP and further included exogenous random shocks to the economy through white noise and occasional bubble bursts. We observe that the Central Bank will regulate according to the inflation or ouput aversion defined in the code, which is in allignment with theory taught in macroeconomics. 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
