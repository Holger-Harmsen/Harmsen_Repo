# Harmsen_Repo

Repository containing various for-fun weekend projects, most of which are somewhat related to the field of economics.

Most of the files are assignments and exam projects from the UCPH courses *'Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis'* (IPNA) led by Jeppe Druedahl and *'Introduction to Social Data Science'* led by David Dreyer-Lassen and Andreas Bjerre-Nielsen.
